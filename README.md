# IPSWOW

I built this tool to help save time. Many customers do not have computers to erase their phones, so I would do it for them, yet it was always an extra wait time of about 15 minutes to download the right IPSW.

Therefore, I wanted a tool to allow for bulk IPSW downloading of the latest firmwares.

This tool is great for developers, repair shops, and schools!
